    "# Simulating Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Gameplay\n",
    "Sequence is a tabletop strategy game, usually played with 2 to 3 people, where each player attempts to be the first to place five of their chips in a row (or \"sequence\") on the board. The board consists of a 10x10 grid, where each square represents a card in a standard deck of cards (except for the Jacks). Each card is represented twice on the board, and the four corners of the grid are \"free spaces\" that can a player can use as part of their sequence. The sequences can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt seven cards from a deck consisting of 104 cards, i.e. two standard decks of cards. They take turns choosing and discarding a card from their hand, placing a chip on one of the matching spaces on the board (as long as it is unoccupied), then drawing another card from the deck. Jacks with two cards can be used as wild cards, to place a chip on any unoccupied space on the board, and Jacks with one eye can be used to remove an opponent's chip from the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first player to get a \"sequence,\" i.e. five chips in a row, wins the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wikipedia page, which contains further explanations and alternative rules and gameplay, can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_(game)\n",
    "###\n",
    "### Simulation\n",
    "I will be simulating a game with only one player and no Jacks in the deck, at first, to see how many moves it takes to win on average. Then, I will attempt to simulate a game with two players and no Jacks in the deck, to see how the average number of moves it takes to win changes."

    "### Representing the Board\n",
    "\n",
    "An essential part of this game is keeping track of which spaces on the board are occupied or not, and so I will be creating a 10x10 numpy array where 1 represents an occupied space and 0 represents an unoccupied space. To keep track of which card is where on the board, I will be creating a python dictionary, where the card is the key, and the two sets of coordinates representing its places on the board are the value."
